**Project Overview**
This project investigates the impact of social media usage on user productivity. In today's digital age, social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube are ubiquitous, offering opportunities for communication and entertainment but also posing risks to productivity. Our analysis seeks to understand these impacts using the "Time-Wasters on Social Media Dataset" created by Muhammad Roshan Riaz.

**Problem Statement**
The primary focus of this project is to analyze how different social media platforms affect user productivity. We aim to quantify the extent of productivity loss associated with various patterns of social media usage. By leveraging data analytics tools, we seek to provide insights into the factors contributing to reduced productivity and identify potential mitigation strategies.

**Project Objectives**
The objectives of this project include:
1.Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and its structure.
2.Applying one-hot encoding to categorical data to prepare it for modeling.
3.Conducting Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and identify key features.
4.Developing and evaluating several predictive models, including:
    4.1 Logistic Regression
    4.2 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    4.3 Decision Tree
    4.4 Random Forest
    4.5 Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
5.Comparing the performance of these models to identify the most effective in predicting the impact of social media usage on productivity.
6.Summarizing findings and providing recommendations based on the results.
